## 🧠 System Architecture

The application follows a **Serverless Client–Database Architecture**:

1. **Client Tier**
   - React + TypeScript SPA  
   - Handles UI, routing, and user interactions  
   - Communicates directly with Supabase APIs  

2. **Logic Tier (Serverless)**
   - Supabase Auth (JWT-based authentication)  
   - PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS)  
   - Supabase Edge Functions for OCR verification  

3. **Data Tier**
   - PostgreSQL (users, posts, projects, chats)  
   - Supabase Storage (media, project files, ID documents)

---

## 🔍 ID Verification System (Core Novelty)

### Workflow
1. User uploads ID document (Image/PDF)  
2. Stored securely in a **private Supabase Storage bucket**  
3. Supabase Edge Function is triggered  
4. **Tesseract.js OCR** extracts text  
5. Extracted data is matched with:
   - User name  
   - College name  
6. Score-based validation (threshold ≥ 70%)  
7. User marked as **Verified**

### Benefits
- No manual admin verification  
- Works even without college email  
- Secure & privacy-preserving
